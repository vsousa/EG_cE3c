README file describing bash and R scripts used in "Prevalent hybridization between highly divergent Iberian chub species produces contrasting outcomes across different geographic and time scales".

Scripts are ordered numerically (starting in 1_) following the order in which they were used in the pipeline described in the paper. If a script requires pulling information from additional files (e.g. a text file with a list), the text file is provided using the same number (e.g. 1_) as the script.
