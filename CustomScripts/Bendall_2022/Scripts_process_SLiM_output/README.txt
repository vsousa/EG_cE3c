# There are two folders with the template for SLiM input files for
# - scaled: in this case the effective size and recombination rates are adjusted, such that both 
#           the hemizygous (haplodiploid) and diploid chromosomes have the same average 4Nu and 4Nr, 
#           where N is the effective size, u is the mutation rate and r is the recombination rate.
