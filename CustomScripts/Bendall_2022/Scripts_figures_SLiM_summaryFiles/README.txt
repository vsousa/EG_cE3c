# This folder contains the following files:
# - plot_Figs_manuscript_FINAL.r 
#      Plot the figures of the manuscript with scaled results, 
#      i.e. 4Nu and 4Nr are scaled such they are on average the same in hemiygous (haplodiploid) and diplois,
#      where N is the effective size, u is the mutation rate and r is the recombination rate.
# - supTableS5.r
#       Script to generate summary of results in Sup. Table S5.
# - SupplementaryTableS5.xlsx
#       Supplementary Table S5 in excel format.

# This folder contains the following folders:
# - Rscripts:
#   functions_plotHeatMap.r definition of R functions to plot heatmaps.
# - SummaryFiles
#   files with a summary of all the simulation results obtained. These were the files obtained after processing output slim files.

# For figures for the sawfly results (SFS, and sims) check the folder
